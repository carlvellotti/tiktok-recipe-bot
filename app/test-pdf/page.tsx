    "Coat the <strong>chicken breasts</strong> (2 large) with a bit of <strong>olive oil</strong> and season them with <strong>salt</strong>, <strong>pepper</strong>, <strong>cumin</strong>, <strong>smoked paprika</strong>, <strong>chili powder</strong>, and <strong>oregano</strong>.",
    "In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt the <strong>butter</strong> (1 T). Add the seasoned <strong>chicken breasts</strong> and sear for a few minutes on each side until a nice crust forms. The chicken does not need to be cooked through. Remove from the pot and set aside.",
    "In the same pot, add a touch more <strong>olive oil</strong> if needed. Add the <strong>diced onion</strong> (1) and <strong>diced jalape√±o</strong> (1). Season with a pinch of <strong>salt</strong>. Saut√© for about 5 minutes until softened.",
    "Add the remaining spices: <strong>ground cumin</strong> (3 tsp), <strong>chili powder</strong> (1 tsp), <strong>smoked paprika</strong> (1 tsp), and <strong>oregano</strong> (1 tsp). Stir and toast the spices for about 30 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Add the <strong>minced garlic</strong> (8-10 cloves) and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring constantly.",
    "Pour in the <strong>chicken broth</strong> (4 cups), <strong>crushed tomatoes</strong> (24 oz can), <strong>canned green chilies</strong> (4 oz can), <strong>diced chipotle peppers</strong> (1 T), and optional <strong>chicken bouillon</strong> (1-2 tsp). Stir to combine.",
    "Add the <strong>bay leaf</strong> (1) and return the seared <strong>chicken breasts</strong> to the pot. Bring the soup to a simmer, then reduce heat, cover, and let it cook for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.",
    "Carefully remove the cooked <strong>chicken breasts</strong> from the pot and discard the <strong>bay leaf</strong>. Using two forks, shred the chicken.",
    "Add the <strong>drained pinto beans</strong> (1 can), <strong>drained corn</strong> (1 can), and the shredded chicken back into the soup. Simmer for a few minutes to heat everything through. Season again with <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> to taste.",
    "Turn the heat to low. Add the <strong>softened cream cheese</strong> (4 oz), a generous amount of <strong>chopped fresh cilantro</strong>, and the <strong>juice of 1 lime</strong>. Stir continuously until the cream cheese is fully melted and incorporated, creating a creamy broth.",
